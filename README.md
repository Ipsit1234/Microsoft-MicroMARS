## Currently there are 8 path-finders bundled in this project, namely:

*  `AStarFinder` *
*  `BiAStarFinder`
*  `BestFirstFinder`
*  `BiBestFirstFinder`
*  `BreadthFirstFinder` * 
*  `BiBreadthFirstFinder` *
*  `DijkstraFinder` *
*  `BiDijkstraFinder` *

The prefix `Bi` in the above list stands for the bi-directional searching strategy.

Also, Note that only the finders with trailing asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.
